# zig-fcfs

Basic FCFS hashmap implemented in zig.

Extremely simple and readable code, mostly made to play around with zig's typing, and to learn how to build a hashmap.

The implementation is fully generic, in approximately 150 loc (doesn't include the hashing algorithm).

See the doc comment for details.
